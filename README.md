# AQI·INTEL — Urban Air Quality Intelligence System

> **Full-stack, multi-city air quality forecasting and enforcement-recommendation platform.**
> Real CPCB data → H3 hex grid → LightGBM 72h ahead forecast → OSM-enriched source attribution → composite urgency scoring → evidence-backed enforcement recommendations.

---

## What This System Does

AQI·INTEL ingests historical air quality data from 4 Indian cities, trains per-city LightGBM models that beat a persistence baseline by 8–20%, and serves a real-time dashboard that:

- **Forecasts AQI 24 / 48 / 72 hours ahead** per H3 hex cell
- **Attributes pollution sources** (traffic proxy, industrial, construction) with per-hex confidence scores derived from OSM road classification and proximity analysis
- **Ranks enforcement actions** by a composite urgency score combining current severity, forecast trend, source confidence, and proximity to schools / hospitals
- **Generates evidence-backed recommendations** — one-sentence basis per action citing real computed values, not hardcoded text
- **Supports 4 cities** (Delhi, Ghaziabad, Noida, Mumbai) with a city-selector UI and cross-city comparison view

## Feature Deep-Dives

### LightGBM Forecast Models

Three separate models per city (24h / 48h / 72h horizon). Separate models outperform a single multi-horizon model because feature importance differs by horizon — `aqi_lag_24h` dominates the 24h model; longer-range temporal patterns matter more at 72h.

**Features used:**
- Pollutant: `pollutant_avg` (PM2.5-primary composite), lag 1h/6h/24h, rolling mean 6h/24h
- Weather: `temperature`, `humidity`, `wind_speed`, `wind_direction` (Open-Meteo API)
- Infrastructure: `city_road_density` (OSM road count)
- Time: `hour_sin`, `hour_cos`, `dow_sin`, `dow_cos` (cyclical encoding)

**Training:** chronological 80/20 split (no data leakage). Evaluated against persistence baseline (predict tomorrow = today).

### Source Attribution Engine

**Traffic proxy** — derived from OSM highway classification, NOT live vehicle telemetry:

| Highway class | Weight | Basis |
|---|---|---|
| motorway | 10× | Expressway / NH — highest PCU |
| trunk | 7× | Major national/state highway |
| primary | 5× | Major arterial (Ring Road, GT Karnal Road) |
| secondary | 3× | Sub-arterial collector |
| tertiary | 1.5× | Local distributor |
| residential | 0.5× | Neighbourhood street |

Each road segment within ~900m of a hex centroid contributes `class_weight × exp(−d / 450m)`. Normalised across hexes.

**Time-of-day multiplier** (AM peak 09:00, PM peak 18:30, floor 0.35×):

```
02:00  ×0.350  Off-peak / night
09:00  ×1.000  Rush hour (peak)
18:00  ×0.965  Rush hour (peak)
23:00  ×0.357  Off-peak / night
```

Applied at API query time — traffic confidence is lower at 2am (when the same roads are likely quiet) and full at rush hour.

**Industrial** — exponential decay proximity to OSM `landuse=industrial` ways/relations (305 elements fetched for Delhi).

**Construction** — proximity to OSM `landuse=construction`, `building=construction`, `amenity=construction` (164 elements).

**Ground-truth matching** — bonus weight from CPCB/DPCC-tagged monitoring station zone types in `data/ground_truth_zones.geojson`.

**Final confidence formula (traffic):**

```
traffic_conf = 0.40 × road_score_norm
             + 0.35 × gt_match_bonus
             + 0.25 × aqi_signal_norm
```

Then scaled by time-of-day multiplier at query time.

### Composite Urgency Scoring

Each flagged hex is scored on four independent signals (0–100 total):

| Component | Weight | Signal |
|---|---|---|
| Current severity | 30% | CPCB band (Good→Severe normalised 0–1) |
| Forecast trend | 30% | Band worsening over 72h + AQI acceleration |
| Source confidence | 20% | Dominant source confidence (ToD-adjusted) |
| Vulnerability | 20% | Schools × 3 + hospitals × 2.5 + parks × 1, within 500m |

Vulnerability data pulled from OSM for each hex: Zone 01 (Mandir Marg) has 7 schools within 500m; Zone 05 (Bawana) has 2 schools + 5 hospitals.

Sorted descending by urgency score. Priority labels:

| Score | Label |
|---|---|
| ≥ 75 | URGENT |
| ≥ 55 | HIGH |
| ≥ 35 | MEDIUM |
| < 35 | LOW |

### Evidence Basis

Each recommendation includes a one-sentence evidence string built from real computed values:

> *"Based on: 97% industrial-source confidence, 2 schools and 5 hospitals within 500 m, AQI improving Severe→Very Poor (−146 over 24 h)."*

> *"Based on: 71% traffic-proxy confidence (road-class weighted, Rush hour), 7 schools and 1 hospital within 500 m, AQI stable at Very Poor (183)."*

Nothing is hardcoded — every figure is derived from the pipeline at runtime.

### Honest Traffic Proxy Framing

The system is explicit at every layer that traffic scores are structural proxies:

- `data/traffic_proxy.py` module docstring
- `/traffic-proxy-info` endpoint — returns `honest_framing` field
- `/source-attribution` — each feature has `proxy_note`, `tod_regime`, `tod_multiplier`
- `/recommendations` — each item has `traffic_proxy_note`
- Frontend — HexPopup shows `TRAFFIC PROXY · OFF-PEAK / NIGHT · ×0.36 (road-class weighted, not live data)`

### Multi-City Support

The pipeline is fully config-driven via `data/cities.py`. Adding a new city requires:
1. An entry in `CITY_REGISTRY` with bbox, centre, zoom, H3 resolution
2. Stations in `location_coords.csv`
3. Running `python data/run_city_pipeline.py --cities <CityName>`

Each city gets its own `data/cache/<city>/` directory with isolated parquet files and model pickles.

### Cross-City Comparison

`/city-stats` returns AQI, forecast trend, and Poor+ % for all cities side by side. The frontend `CityComparison` component renders this as a clickable table — clicking a row switches the active city and flies the map to that city's centre.

**What the comparison does NOT include:** compliance outcomes or intervention effectiveness. That requires real enforcement outcome data which is not available in this dataset. The comparison covers air quality trends only — this is stated explicitly in the UI and API response.

## Limitations & Honest Caveats

1. **Traffic is a proxy, not live data.** `traffic_confidence` is derived from OSM highway classification and a time-of-day diurnal curve. It is not GPS telemetry, not real-time congestion data, and not any mobility feed.

2. **6 hexes per city.** The dataset has 4–6 monitoring stations per city. H3 res-8 maps each station to one hex, so spatial coverage is coarse — not wall-to-wall. This is a limitation of the source data density, not the pipeline design.

3. **Compliance outcomes not included.** The cross-city comparison covers air quality trends only. Intervention effectiveness requires real enforcement outcome data (GRAP compliance logs, vehicle restriction records) which is not in this dataset.

4. **Industrial attribution (non-Delhi).** The OSM-based industrial/construction proximity cache is only fully computed for Delhi. Other cities use rule-based fallback scores.

5. **Weather is city-centre average.** Open-Meteo provides one weather time series per city bounding-box centroid, not per-station or per-hex. Wind direction variation within a city is not captured.
